# OpenCV_Tutorial
A step by step process of how I learnt basics of Open Computer Vision Library using jupyter notebook

OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

Here are the following topics that i got familiar with after covering the basics :

1. Learning how to read images, videos and webcam

2. Basic Functions such as:
   a. Converting RGB image to gray scale image
   b. Blurring an image
   c. Highlighting the edges of an image
   d. Dialation and Erosion in image processing
   e. Resizing and cropping an image

3. Creating various shapes and texts

4. Warp Perspective:
  Perspective Warp algorithm allows for correcting perspective distortion caused by camera misalignment with respect to the object plane being captured. This is the case when the camera is, for instance, pointing to a frame hanging on a wall, but looking from below.
  In the notebook, I have used an image of cards for the same.

5. Joining images

6. Colour Detection using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)

7. Contours and Shape Detection

8.Face detection using cascades found online
